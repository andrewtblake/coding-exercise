# Roman Numerals exercise

- Please timebox yourself to roughly two-hours for this exercise
- We want to see code you're proud of, so spend more time if needed, but please let us know
- Fork this repository on GitHub, and store your code within your own fork
- Ensure your commits are meaningful so we can understand your work process and thinking
- Use either Ruby, Python, Node.js or PHP to program this exercise
- Use TDD to build a roman numeral generator
- Make sure to include sufficient tests to have confidence in your code
- This exercise should include a `RomanNumerals` class with a `generate` method which takes an integer as a single parameter and which returns a string representation in roman numerals
- For example, `29` would return `XXIX`
- You don't need to worry about converting numbers above `1000` for this exercise
- A `Makefile` must be used for this exercise in order to run tests with `make test`
- The `make test` target should display the test runner output
- Update and extend this `README.md` file, ensuring it is informative, relevant and helpful
- All content within this `README.md` file is currently just an example and guide, and can be changed as you see appropriate
- **Stretch goal:** Setup a GitHub Actions pipeline to automate the running of your tests
